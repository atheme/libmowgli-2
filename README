    - mowgli.alloc: A safe wrapper around malloc/free.
    - mowgli.argstack: Safe serialization of valists.
    - mowgli.assert: Various assertion routines that can be used.
    - mowgli.bitvector: Bitmasks with an unlimited level of precision.
    - mowgli.patricia: A keyword-backed definition hashtable class.
    - mowgli.error_backtrace: Provide feedback to users on what caused the
                              error they are recieving.
    - mowgli.exception: Assertions with user feedback.

                   for most common operations.

    - mowgli.module: A wrapper around dlopen(3) and dlsym(3).
    - mowgli.object: A simple class which provides reference counted pointers and
                     polymorphism of structs.
    - mowgli.object_class: Classing and subclassing for objects.
    - mowgli.object_metadata: Metadata for objects.
    - mowgli.object_messaging: Messaging and signalling for objects.
    - mowgli.queue: A simple class which implements double-ended queues.
    - mowgli.random: A high performance psuedo-random number generator.
    - mowgli.signal: A wrapper for sigaction(2).
    - mowgli.eventloop: A portable event loop implementation.
    - mowgli.vio: An abstraction layer for I/O.

implemented.

Installation
------------

Installation is fairly typical:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

(If sudo isn't on your system, su to root. On GNU systems you can even 
do "su -c 'make install'", which is basically the same thing as using 
sudo.)


Bug Reports
